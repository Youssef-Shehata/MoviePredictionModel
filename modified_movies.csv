The oldest member of the group, Amador, has degenerated into alcoholism after being abandoned by his wife; maintaining an increasingly transparent pretense that his wife will soon return from holiday.",0.03572926694710932,"[{""name"": ""V\u00eda Digital"", ""id"": 357}, {""name"": ""Eurimages"", ""id"": 850}, {""name"": ""Continental Producciones"", ""id"": 6279}, {""name"": ""Instituto de la Cinematograf\u00eda y de las Artes Audiovisuales (ICAA)"", ""id"": 9974}, {""name"": ""Televisi\u00f3n de Galicia (TVG) S.A."", ""id"": 10050}, {""name"": ""Antena 3 Televisi\u00f3n"", ""id"": 11737}, {""name"": ""Sogepaq"", ""id"": 11955}, {""name"": ""El\u00edas Querejeta Producciones Cinematogr\u00e1ficas S.L."", ""id"": 12009}, {""name"": ""Mediapro"", ""id"": 12010}, {""name"": ""Quo Vadis Cin\u00e9ma"", ""id"": 12011}, {""name"": ""Eyescreen S.r.l."", ""id"": 12012}]",135,2002-09-27,0.0003162030237581215,0.37362637362637363,284,1,This film is not based on a real story.
